	<p>fuck off? You want me to fuck off? I'm the narrator, I can't "fuck off", but good try!</p>
	<p>So because you told me to "fuck off" I am going to give you the Asshole profession. Confused? Let me explain</p>
	<p>Being an Asshole means that you were kicked out of your clan and city because of your bad attitude and poor judge of humor, all of your decisions will be rude and mean. You will have a terrible time making allies or even friends.</p>
