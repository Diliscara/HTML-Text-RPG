	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>I am playing around with CSS and HTML (probably a little bit of Java and/or Javascript too) and making a small text-based rpg</p>
	<p>So, would you like to play and help me out with feedback? Or just go back to the main page?</p>
	<p>For giving me feedback, I will add my email address at the bottom of each page.</p>
	<p>Also, for better experience, it would be best for you to minimize this page to half screen</p>
<a class="link" href="I_Quit.html">I would rather not play</a>
<a class="link" href="Sure_Why_Not.html">Sure, I'll play along</a>
