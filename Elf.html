	<p>So you're an elf? Okay, hold on a sec. I need to think about it...</p>
	<p>Okay, I'm back. So Elves are roughly 9 feet tall and usually weigh about 140lbs. Basically you're average fantasy role-play elf character.</p>
	<p>I won't go too much into specifics, but feel free to write it down on a scrap piece of paper if you wish. I might add a box for you to type in the specifics later.</p>
	<p>Now for your gender. Are you a boy? Or a girl? (hahaha, Pokemon game reference)</p>
